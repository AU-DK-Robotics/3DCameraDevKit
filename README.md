# 3DCamera Development Kit

This repository is a guideline for students and researchers to use 3D cameras in the Robotics Laboratory at Aarhus University, Denmark. We now support the following 3D cameras:

- Pico Monstar, a **Time of Flight (ToF)-based** camera from [pmd tech](https://3d.pmdtec.com/en/).
- LIPSedge L215u/L210u, a **Structured Light(SL)-based** camera, from [LIPS](https://www.lips-hci.com/).
